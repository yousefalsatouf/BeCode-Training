== The mission

NOTE: All field, except _subject_, have to be completed. The field _subject_
takes a default value of *others*.

* the form *must have* semantical HTML
* the HTML *must be* accessible to the blinds
* in case of wrong input return the form with a visual error display
* display the error message near the correct input field
* the error message must be readable (helpful to users)
* the form has to be *sanitised* and *validated* (server side)
* if an answer validate, respond by email to a given address

Optional:

* work on a good and clear _user experience_ (UX)
* send some *love to your coach* through the form
* respond to the user request with {ajax}[Ajax]

==== Part 0: plan the work ahead

Study all the project aspects, from frontend to backend, then make a mock-up and
finally start coding.

==== Part 1: contact form (html)

Start by creating the HTML of the form, don't forget the *progressive
enhancement* and accessibility to the blinds

==== Part 2: contact form (css, via framework css)

Use *bootstrap* to quickly get your visual, while respecting the graphic chart
below.

* font: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bellota 
* logo's color: #15c5bd

==== Part 3: contact form (PHP)

To help you during development, display the *rough data* received from the form
with the help of the :php:[print_r] PHP function.

==== Part 4: process the form data

Finally, sanitize the input from things like `<script>`, then validate the
content (obligatory field, valid email, etc...), ending by an email sent and a
feedback for the user
