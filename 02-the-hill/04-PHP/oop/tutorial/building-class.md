# Building the class

## Access Modifiers

[PHP Docs: Visibility](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php)

Access modifiers allows us to control the access, or visibility, of our properties. If declared using var, the property will be defined as public. When declaring a property, the visibility MUST be defined by an access modifier.

* **Public**: Publicly accessible from anywhere, even from outside the scope of the class.

* **Private**: Accessed within the class itself. It protects properties and methods from being accessed from outside the class.

* **Protected**: Same as private, except by allowing child (sub) classes to access protected parent (super) properties and methods.

### Don't Allow Property Change
If we wanted to keep someone from changing a property after itâ€™s been set the first time, we could use two different options. Both require that the property itself is set to private. Only allow the property to be set in the `__construct` method and don't set up another method to change the property. Add a conditional to any method that modifies the property to first check that the property is empty before adding a value.

### Using Private Methods
Methods use access modifiers as well. So we can also use private to define a method. We may want to setup a method for formatting a property, but we only want to call that method from the `__construct` method or another method that combines more logic. For example, we only want to allow updating the user's name if we also verify the user's email.


### Why Getters and Setters

Some of these are concepts we wont be covering in this course, but here are a few ides:

Controlling the of behavior associated with getting or setting the property - this allows additional functionality (like validation) to be added more easily later.
Hiding the internal representation of the property while exposing a property using an alternative representation.
Allowing the getter/setter to be passed around as lambda expressions rather than values.
Getters and setters can allow different access levels - for example the get may be public, but the set could be protected.
Insulating your public interface from change - allowing the public interface to remain constant while the implementation changes without affecting existing consumers.
Providing a debugging interception point for when a property changes at runtime.
Improved interoperability with libraries that are designed to operate against property getter/setters - Mocking, Serialization, etc.
Allowing inheritors to change the semantics of how the property behaves and is exposed by overriding the getter/setter methods.
