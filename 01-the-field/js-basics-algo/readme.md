# Algorithmics with JavaScript

## Training goals

Algorithmics is the very base of the developer job. We will learn it with the JavaScript language.

At the end of this training the trainee will have mastered the following aspect of JavaScript:

* Variables
* Operators
* Arrays
* Control Structures
* Functions
* Objects
* Classes

The trainee will then be able to begin its learning of JavaScript in the context of Web Development.

### Guidelines for all exercises

Before beginning the exercises create a public Github repository in your Github account named **algo-js**.

For each exercise create a `.js` file named like the the number of the exercise. Example: **`1.1.js`**. Commit and push your git repository after each exercise.

This directive is important both to make you practice git and to allow us to follow your progression in the exercises.
