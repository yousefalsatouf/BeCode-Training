# Algorithmics with JavaScript 03 - Arrays

Arrays are one of the simplest data structures in programming. They allow to store a collection of elements in a precise order.

## Theory

### Declaration

```javascript
let emptyArray = []; // an empty array

let numbersArray = [1, 2, 3]; // an array with 3 numbers

let stringsArray = ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana", "Cherry"]; // an array with 4 strings
```

It's not much more complicated.

### Access a specific element

```javascript
let arr = ["Gerard", "Lambert"];

console.log("Hello " + arr[Ã˜] + " " + arr[1]);
```

The `[]` syntax allows to access a specific element in the array using its index. Note that, in JavaScript, we always consider that indexes start at `0`. So the first element is at index `0`, the second one at index `1`, etc...

You can also modify a specific element this way:

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr[2] = 4;

console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 4]
```

### Obtain the size of an array

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

console.log("The size is " + arr.length); // display "The size is 3"
```

`<array>.length` gives the number of elements in an array

### Add and remove elements from an array

```javascript
let arr = ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana"];

console.log(arr); // ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana"]

arr.push("Cherry");

console.log (arr); // ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana", "Cherry"]

arr.pop();

console.log(arr); // ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana"]
```

`push()` and `pop()` respectively. Note that they only work on the end of the array.

### Iterate on an array

Quite often we need to iterate on arrays to perform some operation on all its elements. You will see different techniques.

The old-and-ugly-but-it-works:

```javascript
let arr = ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana"];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
  console.log("Do you want to eat a " + arr[i] + "?");
}
```

And the cool-kids:

```javascript
let arr = ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana"];

for (let elem of arr) {
  console.log("Do you want to eat a " + elem + "?");
}
```

The `for...of` is a specific syntax to iterate on arrays. Try to use it for readability.

## Exercises

### Exercise 3.1

Write a program that will add all the elements of an array.

Test it with the following arrays:

* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` => 15
* `[100, 101, 102]` => 303

### Exercise 3.2

Write a program that will calculate the average value of a given array.

Test it with the following arrays:

* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` => 3
* `[100, 101, 102]` => 101

### Exercise 3.3

Write a program that will create a duplicate of a given array.

Bonus: make a first version that will only do it using `push()`. Make a second version that uses a single method call to perform the copy. (You'll have to search on the MDN or Google for this one.) 

### Exercise 3.4

Write a program that will display the minimum and maximum elements of a given array.
