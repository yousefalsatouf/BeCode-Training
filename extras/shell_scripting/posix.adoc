Type of challenge: *learning* +
Duration: *3 hours* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* know what *POSIX* is
* be able to convert scripts to *POSIX*
* be able to write *POSIX* scripts


== The mission

Portability might not be one of your primary concerns, but you'll be glad to
know {posix}[POSIX] if you ever find yourself executing the same script on
different UNIX (variants) systems, with different shells.

You should first take time to research the different rules to respect in order
to have a _POSIX_ script, then convert the _BASH script_ below to its POSIX
equivalent.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/env sh

FILES_PATH=(one.txt two.txt three.txt)
FOLDER=/tmp/bashism

mkdir -p $FOLDER
for I in ${FILES_PATH[*]}; do
	if ! [[ -f $FOLDER/$I ]]; then
		head -n 30 /dev/urandom > $FOLDER/$I
	fi
done
----

NOTE: You can check if a script is _POSIX_ with tools like {check}[shellcheck],
it exist both as a website or a CLI command.

== Congrats

It might feel annoying to comply with *POSIX* and sometimes it doesn't even make
sense, but whenever you want to use your script on *multiple system* you should
remember what you learned here.
