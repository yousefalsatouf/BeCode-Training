Type of challenge: *learning* +
Duration: *1 day* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* be comfortable with the *shell script* syntax
* know how to run a *shell script*
* know how to execute a *shell script*


== The mission

It's a good thing to know what a *shell script* is, it's even better to know how
to write one yourself. Hopefully that's exactly what we're going to try in this
challenge. Follow this {tuto}[tutorial] (or others) on shell scripting then
complete the exercises below to ensure fundamental understanding.

.Tips
. You can append the extension `.sh` to your script for clarity.
. A {shebang}[shebang] is needed to indicate to the shell what language to use.
. To make a file executable use {chmod}[chmod].
. Run your script with `./file.sh`.

=== Exercises

==== I - prompt user

Write a shell script *prompting* the user for his name, then replying `Hello
<name>`.

==== II - receive arguments

Write a shell script *receiving* a name as *argument*, then replying `Hello
<name>`.

==== III - path to

Write a shell script receiving a *path* as argument, depending on if it's a file
or a directory, display or list its content.

You can complexify the script by only displaying file containing text (ex:
`.txt`, `.js`) and returning an error for anything else (ex: `.mp3`, `.pdf`).

==== IV - informations

Write a shell script to see the current date, time, username, and directory.

==== V - list of groups

Write a shell script checking all the {groups}[groups] a user is part of and for
each one display `<username> is part of the group <group>`.

how to use it.
