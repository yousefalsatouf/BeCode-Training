To understand what's a *shell script* you need to know what a *shell* and
a *script* are, read this {info}[article] for more informations.

By now you might have understood that your _terminal_ runs a *shell* and that
this shell is the one translating your commands to the system.

When you type instructions within the command line you are actually speaking in
the *shell scripting* language, meaning you can *write these instructions into a
file*, then feed them to the shell to accomplish any task you would directly
from your prompt.

So what's a *shell script* in the end? Well it's simply a file containing all
the instructions required to automate a frequently done task.

NOTE: The shell scripting language is especially good at processing data (input,
output) and system administration, but it should be complemented with other
languages (C, Python, Ruby, etc...) for other tasks.
