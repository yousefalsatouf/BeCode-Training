This folder contains courses that are not directly related to web development or
simply not in the program. Feel free to explore them whenever you find yourself
with some _time to kill_.

Given that you might also have interesting *skills* or *knowledge* to share with
your coworkers, you are also *encouraged* to write courses yourself. To do so
you should follow this link:./course_template/[template], then make a
{prequest}[pull request].

NOTE: If you decide to propose a track don't forget to add a link to it in the
_briefings_ section of this file.
