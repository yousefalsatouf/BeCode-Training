= Course template

This template sole purpose is to give you a _guideline_, the text in each
section should be replaced by the appropriate content. If you want to structure
your track in a different way it's your call. 

When writing a course and before you give challenges, it's usually a good idea
to add a small, or not, description of the subject, how it works, its goals,
etc...

Here at BeCode we try to teach with an *active learning mindset* by having
interactive conversation in the classroom, using exercises (challenges) to teach
and implicating you in the process of building your formation.

NOTE: You can always refer to the tracks you received from your coach to have
examples.
